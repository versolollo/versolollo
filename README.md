## Projects I have been working on:

- **Microprocessor Steady state heat simulation:** it involved solving the heat equation in 2D in order to simulate the temperature distribution in a microprocessor working at full speed. I investigated the system, with and without heat sink an with natural or forced convection (i.e. cooling it using a fan).
- **Networks Barabasi model:** I developed and investigated a Barabasi network. In particular, i focused on the degree distribution of the nodes under mixed attachment condition.
- **Fresnel Simulation:** I developed a routine to propagate a light field from an input plane to an output plane through a sequence of lenses and free space propagations.
- **Crop Yield Prediction:** Code I developed together with three other team mates as part of the 2021 ICDS (Imperial College Data science Society) AI-Hackaton. The code was developed in 24h and it includes data preprocessing, algorithm design and training and data plotting.
