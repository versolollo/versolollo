## My Portfolio

Hello everyone! This brand new site contains a not exhaustive list of the things I have been doing, particularly with computers and hardware.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Computing
I started coding in Python in highschool with the purpose of creating a "bass harmoniser" which had to find the right musical chords over a bass line. I then continued during University, and here are somme of the projects I worked on:

- **Thermal Simulation:** a thermal simulation which solves the 2D steady-state heat equation to find the temperature map in a microprocessor. I implemented Newton's method to solve the heat equation.
- **Oslo model**

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/versolollo/versolollo/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
