## My Portfolio (Work in Progress)


> Work in progress! This site is under development, so don't expect all the information to be here :))

Hello everyone! This brand new site contains a not exhaustive list of the things I have been doing, particularly with computers and hardware.

### Computing
Here is a (not extensive) list of the projects that I worked on. 

| Project                 | Brief Description    | Language  | Year |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------|------|
| [Thermal Simulation][1] | Solving steady state heat PDE to simulate a microprocessor using numerical methods.   | Python    | 2020 |
| Oslo Model              |                      |Python     | 2021 |
| Barabasi-Albert Network |                      | Python    | 2021 |
| Pulse Oximeter          | Code for a pulse oximeter made using the pic18f87k22 microprocessor. Written in assembler with my lab partner ([check the repo][microlab]). | Assembler | 2021 |
