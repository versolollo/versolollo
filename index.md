## My Portfolio (Work in Progress)

Hello everyone! This brand new site contains a not exhaustive list of the things I have been doing, particularly with computers and hardware.

### Computing
I started coding in Python in highschool with the purpose of creating a "bass harmoniser" which had to find the right musical chords over a bass line. I then continued during University, and here are somme of the projects I worked on:

- **Thermal Simulation:** a thermal simulation which solves the 2D steady-state heat equation to find the temperature map in a microprocessor. I implemented Newton's method to solve the heat equation. The project was part of my Computational Physics module at University;
- **Oslo model:** I investigated the Oslo Model, which displays _Self Organised Criticality (SOC)_ for my Complexity & Networks module at university;
